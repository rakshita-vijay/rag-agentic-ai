### Types of Model Response Reneration:
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation): the model goes out, finds things that have been updated in the world after it has breen trained, and incorporates that information into its answer
- Fine Tuning: specialized model that is trained on, say, transcripts of a video, or basically, specific, small, niche dataset
  - the process of taking a pre-trained model and further training it on a specific, smaller dataset related to a particular task or domain
- Prompt Engineering: giving specifics to the model to differentiate between useful and useless data from the web
