### Types of Model Response Reneration:
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation): the model goes out, finds things that have been updated in the world after it has breen trained, and incorporates that information into its answer
  
- Fine Tuning: specialized model that is trained on, say, transcripts of a video, or basically, specific, small, niche dataset
  - the process of taking a pre-trained model and further training it on a specific, smaller dataset related to a particular task or domain

- Prompt Engineering: giving specifics to the model to differentiate between useful and useless data from the web

1. converts the query (user question) and all the documents into vector embeddings (long list of numbers that represent its meaning)
2. finds semantically equivalent info
3. converts it into human-readable format
